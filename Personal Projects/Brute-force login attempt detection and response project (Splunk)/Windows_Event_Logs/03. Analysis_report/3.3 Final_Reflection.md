# Final Analysis 
Throughout the investigation using Splunk, I identified the total 11 Source IP (203.0.113.76, 203.0.113.45, 45.33.32.156, 45.79.0.12, 104.244.42.1, 198.51.100.23, 162.243.187.132, 185.199.108.45, 51.79.19.58, 23.235.33.141, 8.8.8.8) with Brute-force Attack RiskLevel High due to the fact that these source ip attempted to login and failed (EventID = 4625) over 20 times one-hour window. Those attacks were distributed, persistent, and consistent brute-force attempts.

# Final Reflection – Brute-Force Login Attempt Detection & Response Project (Splunk)
This project provided me with hands-on experience simulating a real-world brute-force login attack detection and response system with Windows_Event_Logs using Splunk. I began by preparing a synthetic Windows Event Log dataset that resembled realistic failed login attempts (Event ID 4625), generated using ChatGPT-4o. 
By parsing and extracting key fields such as SourceIP, AccountName, and LogonType, I designed SPL queries to identify suspicious login patterns—specifically those indicating remote brute-force attacks via network logons (LogonType 3).
To enhance detection capabilities, I enriched the dataset with geolocation information using the iplocation command. Although the synthetic IP addresses couldn't be resolved, I found this step valuable for learning how to incorporate geolocation analysis-something that would be crucial in real-world investigations involving external threat actors. 
I also developed multiple visualizations, including line charts and pie charts, to analyze the behavior and distribution of attackers over time. This process taught me how the right chart type can dramatically affect how threat data is interpreted and acted upon.

One of the most impactful aspects of this project was simulating a complete threat response workflow. I implemented logic to flag high-risk IP addresses exceeding 20 failed login attempts per hour, tagged them accordingly, and exported them into a lookup table. These IPs were then reused to simulate real-time detection in the future. I also set up Splunk to trigger an alert when it detected brute-force behavior. After building it, I felt proud of myself for being able to organize and visualize all these metrics in one place. It would be incredibly exciting to build something like this using real data from an actual live environment. 

Through this process, I learned how to identify threats and design effective responses. I also discovered how to automate routine tasks and clearly communicate technical findings. This experience highlighted the importance of not only developing detection logic, but also building actionable workflows that security teams can use in real time. 

Moving forward, I plan to incorporate SOAR tools such as Splunk Phantom to automate response actions and simulate more realistic incident handling. I also aim to improve data quality by integrating threat intelligence feeds like AbuseIPDB, which would provide real-world IP behavior and improve detection accuracy. Although I initially struggled to find a suitable dataset for this simulation and had to generate one using ChatGPT-4o, this challenge helped me understand just how specific and detailed a dataset needs to be for effective detection engineering. It also led me to explore new sources for both simulated and real log datasets for future projects. 

Additionally, with MITRE T1110 Mapping, I reflected on how the detection logic in this project aligns with real-world adversary behavior. Mapping the brute-force login activity to T1110 (Credential Access – Brute Force)helped me connect my work to an established threat framework and reinforced the importance of standardizing detection using models like MITRE ATT&CK. 
This step made the project feel less like a simulation and more like a real-world security operation. 

Overall, this project helped me understand SIEM operations and threat intelligent workflows. It reinforced the need for data quality, automation, and visualization in cybersecurity today. 
More importantly, it gave me confidence to use standard tools to solve complex problems. I learned that I love to find patterns in data, design the best response, and communicate the technical detail in a clear way. I hope to take those skills into a potential security operations or threat hunting role that requires analytical thinking and clear communication.
