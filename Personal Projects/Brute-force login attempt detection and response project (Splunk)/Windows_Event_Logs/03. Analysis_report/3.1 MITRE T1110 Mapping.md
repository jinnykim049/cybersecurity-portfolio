# MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
- What is MITRE ATT&CK framework and why MITRE ATT&CK Mapping matter?: 
The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques, based on real-world observations of cyberattacks. 

MITRE ATT&CK mapping refers to the practice of aligning security detections, logs, and incidents with specific tactics and techniques from the ATT&CK matrix. 
It is crucial because it enhances threat detection coverage by identifying gaps across known attack techniques. 
It enables a threat-in  formed defense, helping security teams prioritize based on real-world adversary behavior rather than theoretical risks. 
During incident response and threat hunting, the mapping offers valuable insight into attacker tactics, speeding up analysis and response. By standardizing terminology (e.g., T1110 for brute force), it improves communication across teams, tools, and reports. It also strengthens executive reporting by clearly showing what threats were detected or missed, and supports alignment with compliance frameworks like NIST and ISO 27001. 


**MITRE T1110 Mapping â€“ Brute-Force Login Detection**
Technique ID: T1110
Technique Name: Brute Force
Description: This technique involves the use of exhaustive or automated password-guessing attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems or accounts. Tactic of this is Credential Access 


*Evidence Mapped from This Project*
1. Indicator - Multiple failed login attempts
Evidence: Event ID 4625 (Failed logon)  
How it maps to T1110: Indicates repeated unauthorized attempts 

2. Indicator - Same SourceIP trying multiple usernames  
Evidence: Extracted via SPL: stats count by SourceIP, AccountName  
How it maps to T1110: Suggests brute-force login trial 

3. Indicator - Use of LogonType 3
Evidence: Filtered via: where LogonType == 3 
How it maps to T1110: Indicates remote network-based login attempts 

4. Indicator - Frequency analysis over time 
Evidence: timechart span=1m count   
How it maps to T1110: Shows persistence and automation behavior 



* Notes:
- This project simulates a typical brute-force scenario using synthetic logs.
- The mapped behavior in this project closely resembles what blue teams monitor in real environments.
