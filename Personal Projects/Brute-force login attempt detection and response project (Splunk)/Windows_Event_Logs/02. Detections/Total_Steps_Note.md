# Get Ready 
- Download Splunk App from https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download.html
- Get Log data Source (Navigate to Brute-force login attempt detection and response project (Splunk)/Windows_Event_Logs/01. Data/README.md for more information)


< Step by Step Process >
# Step 1: Log Data Collection and Preparation
To simulate a realistic brute-force attack scenario, I used a synthetic Windows Event Log dataset generated with AI- ChatGPT-4o.

You can view the dataset here:
(Personal Projects/Brute-force login attempt detection and response project (Splunk)/Windows_Event_Logs/01. Data/sample_windows_event_log.json)
 
and find more information about my chosen dataset under (Brute-force login attempt detection and response project (Splunk)/Windows_Event_Logs/01. Data)


# Step 2: Data Ingestion into Splunk
Next, I launched Splunk, then navigated to:
"Settings -> Add Data -> Upload File"

I selected the sample_windows_event_log.json file from my device and followed the guided process to index the data.

Below is Key ingestion configuration:
Source type: json
Index: splunk_project_index 
-> I avoided to use the default index (main) because Splunk puts all the test/sample/default logs in the main by default, so it can be mixed with other data when querying later. 
 

# Step 3: Brute-force Login Attempt Detection using SPL
**Objective** - Detect potential brute-force login attempts by identifying repeated failed login events (Event ID 4625) from the 'sample_windows_event_log.json' dataset.

**Detection Logic**
Indicators of a brute-force attack:
  - A high number of failed logon attempts from the same SourceIP
  - Multiple failed attempts originating from the same external IP targeting the same AccountName
  - LogonType 3 (network logon) —> often used in external remote brute-force attacks 

**SPL Query**
source="sample_windows_event_log.json" host="Jinnys-MacBook-Pro.local" index="splunk_project_index" sourcetype="_json" 
| spath
| search EventID=4625
| rex field=Message "(?s)Account For Which Logon Failed:.*?Account Name:\t(?<AccountName>[^\r\n]+)"
| rex field=Message "Source Network Address:\t(?<SourceIP>\S+)"
| stats count by SourceIP, AccountName
| sort -count
 

Explanation -> This query is to identify IPs repeatedly trying and failing to log into specific user accounts. It tells who (AccountName) was targeted, from where (SourceIP), how many times (count), and most aggressive attack sources (at the top)


In detail- 
Line 31: to specify the data source.
Line 32: to parse the structured JSON fields. (spath enables accessing nested JSON fields as separate searchable fields. Without it, Splunk may treat the entire event as a raw string.)
Line 33: to filter for Windows Event ID 4625 - which is Failed Logon Attempt. 

Line 34: to extract the AccountName from the raw Message field. (rex: regular expression)
- (?s): Enables multiline mode so . matches newline characters.
- Account For Which Logon Failed:.*?Account Name:\t matches the section preceding the actual username.
- (?<AccountName>[^\r\n]+): captures the actual account name, stopping at newline or carriage return. 

Line 35: to extract the IP address of the device attempting the login. 
- Source Network Address:\t :matches the label.
- (?<SourceIP>\S+): captures the non-space characters after the tab — the actual IP address.
Source Network Address:\t matches the label.

Line 36: to aggregate the number of failed login attempts by each SourceIP and AccountName pair.
Line 37: to sort the results in descending order by the number of attempts.


After running this query, I got to see this result - (View image: Personal Projects/Brute-force login attempt detection and response project (Splunk)/Windows_Event_Logs/Appendix/Screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-03 at 8.26.05 PM.png). 

-Bonus: 
I could also add this below to the query.
"| rex field=Message "Logon Type:\t+(?<LogonType>\d+)"
| where LogonType == "3"  "
-> This query is to filter by LogonType 3 which is network logon that is triggered when a user logs in over the network (e.g., SMB, remote connections). 
These lines are good to include because LogonType 3 is the most common logon type in remote brute-force attempts. 

* Final query: 
**SPL Query to detect Brute-Force attacks**  
source="sample_windows_event_log.json" host="Jinnys-MacBook-Pro.local" index="splunk_project_index" sourcetype="_json"
| spath
| search EventID=4625
| rex field=Message "(?s)Account For Which Logon Failed:.*?Account Name:\t(?<AccountName>[^\r\n]+)"
| rex field=Message "Source Network Address:\t(?<SourceIP>\S+)"
| rex field=Message "Logon Type:\t+(?<LogonType>\d+)"
| where LogonType == "3"
| stats count by SourceIP, AccountName
| sort -count



After running this query, I got to see this result - (View image: Personal Projects/Brute-force login attempt detection and response project (Splunk)/Windows_Event_Logs/Appendix/Screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-03 at 8.45.43 PM.png).


Then I could conclude that there were 250 failed logons (250 events have Event ID: 4625)out of 850 activities, and out of 250 failed logons, there were 86 unique combinations of SourceIP and AccountName - each shown once with a count of how many times it occurred. 
The most aggressive Brute-Force attacks was from IP address 203.0.113.45 with AccountName: testuser with 32 login attempts within an hour. 



# Step 4: Enhancing Detection with Geolocation Enrichment 
To better understand the origin of the brute-force attempts, I enriched the data with geolocation information (City, Country, Region, etc.) using the iplocation command in Splunk.

I added this below to the query (from Step 3) 
"| iplocation SourceIP
| fillnull value="N/A" City Country Region lat lon"

So final SPL Query with GeoIP enrichment:
**SPL Query to detect Brute-Force attacks (with GeoIP enrichment)** 
source="sample_windows_event_log.json" host="Jinnys-MacBook-Pro.local" index="splunk_project_index" sourcetype="_json"
| spath
| search EventID=4625
| rex field=Message "(?s)Account For Which Logon Failed:.*?Account Name:\t(?<AccountName>[^\r\n]+)"
| rex field=Message "Source Network Address:\t(?<SourceIP>\S+)"
| rex field=Message "Logon Type:\t+(?<LogonType>\d+)"
| where LogonType == "3"
| iplocation SourceIP
| fillnull value="N/A" City Country Region lat lon
| stats count by SourceIP, AccountName, City, Country, Region, lat, lon
| sort -count
 

After running this query, I got this result below: 
(Personal Projects/Brute-force login attempt detection and response project (Splunk)/Windows_Event_Logs/Appendix/Screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-03 at 9.25.27 PM.png)


From here, I found the limitation of my dataset. 
I noticed that all geolocation fields (City, Country, Region, etc.) returned as N/A for every SourceIP.
This is because Splunk’s iplocation command relies on an internal GeoIP database (such as MaxMind) to map real, public IP addresses to physical locations.

However, the dataset I used is fully synthetic and AI-generated. The SourceIP addresses in it fall into one of the following categories:
1. Reserved for documentation (e.g., 203.0.113.x) - used for tutorials or test scenarios, not assigned to any real-world location.
2. Non-routable/internal IPs (e.g., 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x) — used within private networks and never routed on the public internet.
3. Random/generated IPs — that do not exist in the real world and therefore have no entry in the GeoIP database.

Thus, iplocation couldn't resolve any of these IPs to real-world geographic info, resulting in all N/A values. 

Here is a solution for future work to enable meaningful geolocation enrichment. 
The dataset should include valid external IP addresses, such as those seen in real-world brute-force attempts. These could be obtained from threat intelligence feeds (e.g., AbuseIPDB, AlienVault OTX), Public datasets from incident response labs, Masked or obfuscated logs from controlled environments, or generated using AI models trained on real-world IP behavior patterns.. etc. 




# Step 5: Visualization 
**Objective** Summarize brute-force detection results using Splunk's visualization features to enhance analysis and communication. 

* Note- Pie and bar charts in Splunk require a simple structure — typically a single categorical field (e.g., SourceIP) and a numeric value (count).
Therefore, it is standard to use stats count by <one field> to generate visualizations.

For this step, I decided to use SourceIP as the grouping field, to identify which IPs were attempting the most login and experienced failures. 

**What I Did** 
I ran this query below: 
source="sample_windows_event_log.json" host="Jinnys-MacBook-Pro.local" index="splunk_project_index" sourcetype="_json" 
| spath
| search EventID=4625
| rex field=Message "(?s)Account For Which Logon Failed:.*?Account Name:\t(?<AccountName>[^\r\n]+)"
| rex field=Message "Source Network Address:\t(?<SourceIP>\S+)"
| stats count by SourceIP
| sort -count 


and I clicked on Visualization tab and selected different chart types to find the most intuitive one. 

**Key Visualizations:**
* Line Chart: (View chart: Personal Projects/Brute-force login attempt detection and response project (Splunk)/Windows_Event_Logs/Appendix/Screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-04 at 2.47.02 PM.png) 

From this chart, I observed:
- A total of 11 unique SourceIP addresses attempted brute-force logins.
- The most aggressive attack was from ip address 203.0.113.76, with 66 failed login attempts using various Account Names. 

- The least aggressive attack was from ip address 8.8.8.8, with 34 login attempts using various Account Names. 
- There were three attackers, 162.243.187.132, 185.199.108.45, 51.79.19.58, who attempted the same number of login attempts (40 counts - Look at the flat line)
 


* Pie Chart: 
(View chart: Personal Projects/Brute-force login attempt detection and response project (Splunk)/Windows_Event_Logs/Appendix/Screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-04 at 3.15.16 PM.png )


From this chart, I observed:
- Attacks were spread across 11 different IP addresses. While 203.0.113.76 and 203.0.113.45 have slightly larger slices, the differences between each portions are not extreme. This suggests distributed brute-force attempts rather than a single or few persistent attacker. 
- The use of distinct color segments helps visually confirm that the attack volume is relatively balanced across all IPs.
- Since the counts are close, this may indicate the use of automated tools or bots rotating through multiple IPs to avoid detection. 


=> However, when I reviewed the Line Chart, I noticed that the number of attack attempts varied significantly across different source IP addresses.
This same pattern was also visible in the Bar and Column charts. (Bar chart: Personal Projects/Brute-force login attempt detection and response project (Splunk)/Windows_Event_Logs/Appendix/Screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-04 at 3.06.45 PM.png , Column chart: Personal Projects/Brute-force login attempt detection and response project (Splunk)/Windows_Event_Logs/Appendix/Screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-04 at 3.07.24 PM.png)
Although all of these charts represent the same data, they can lead to slightly different interpretations depending on the visualization used.
This made me realize how important it is to choose the right chart type when analyzing and reporting on attack behavior.

In this case, I believe the Line Chart or Bar Chart is more appropriate than the Pie Chart or Column chart.
The difference between the most aggressive attacker (66 failed login attempts) and the least (34 attempts) is quite significant, so it's inaccurate to say that the attacks were evenly distributed across all IP addresses. 



# Step 6: Time-Based Attack Pattern Analysis 
**Objective** So far, I focused on who (what ip adddresses) attacked and how much each attacked over time. However, this step is to identify when the failed login attempts were most concentrated. (burst or persistent?)
This type of time-based analysis is important when designing alert thresholds and identifying peak attack periods in real-world security operations.

In this case, my dataset (sample_windows_event_log.json) contains an EventTime field, so I was able to use timechart without needing to manually convert the timestamp using eval _time.
This below is the query that I ran. 

**SPL Query for Time-Based Analysis**
source="sample_windows_event_log.json" host="Jinnys-MacBook-Pro.local" index="splunk_project_index" sourcetype="_json"
| spath
| search EventID=4625
| rex field=Message "(?s)Account For Which Logon Failed:.*?Account Name:\t(?<AccountName>[^\r\n]+)"
| rex field=Message "Source Network Address:\t(?<SourceIP>\S+)"
| timechart span=1m count


timechart span=1m count -> This query generates a time-series visualization that shows how many failed login attempts (Event ID 4625) occurred each minute.

(View image after runnng this query: Personal Project/ Brute-force login attempt detection and response project (Splunk)/Windows_Event_Logs/Appendix/Screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-04 at 3.50.12 PM.png )

From this line chart, I observed: 
- The failed login attempts occurred consistently over the entire 1-hour period.This suggests a persistent brute-force rather than a short burst.
- The number of failed login attempts fluctuates per minute, ranging roughly from 3 to 10 attempts per minute.
- There are clear spikes from time to time. The highest spike is at 12:11, hitting 10 counts.
- There are no significant idle periods; this indicates that the attacker was continuously active, likely using a scripted attack tool.
- The regularity and repetition of attack waves imply the use of automation, such as password-spraying scripts or botnets. 


# Step 7: Threat Response Simulation 
**Objective** This step is to simulate how suspicious IPs can be flagged and tracked using Splunk to support security operations, including incident response, threat hunting, and future detection rules.


**What I Did** 
* 1) Define a Threshold for “Suspicious” Behavior.
There’s no universal threshold for what number of login attempts in an hour from one IP constitutes a brute-force attack. However, there is a general rule of thumb that: 

1. More than 5–10 failed login attempts within a short time (e.g., 1–5 minutes) is often enough to flag suspicion.
2. 20–50+ attempts within an hour from the same IP is commonly used as a threshold to detect brute-force patterns in SIEM tools like Splunk. 

With this, I defined a rule:
Any IP with more than 20 failed login attempts in an hour is considered “high risk”. 



* 2) Mark High-Risk IPs with "eval". 
this below is query that counts failed attempts per IP following by the defined rule, then tags high-risk ones using eval 

**SPL Query for flagging High-Risk IPs**
source="sample_windows_event_log.json" host="Jinnys-MacBook-Pro.local" index="splunk_project_index" sourcetype="_json"
| spath
| search EventID=4625
| rex field=Message "(?s)Account For Which Logon Failed:.*?Account Name:\t(?<AccountName>[^\r\n]+)"
| rex field=Message "Source Network Address:\t(?<SourceIP>\S+)"
| stats count by SourceIP
| eval RiskLevel=if(count > 20, "High", "Normal")
| sort -count

-------------
Query Explanation: 
| eval RiskLevel=if(count > 20, "High", "Normal") 
-> If the total number of failed login attempts from an IP exceeds 20 in this dataset (which spans approximately one hour), the RiskLevel is set to "High"; otherwise, it's "Normal". 

This is what I saw after running the query above: (Personal Project/Brute-force login attempt detection and response project (Splunk)/Windows_Event_Logs/Appendix/Screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-04 at 9.33.21 PM.png)

From this, I observed that all 11 SourceIPs that got EventID = 4625 were classified as RiskLevel: High since they all tried to login (and failed) over 20 times in about an hour (throughout the whole dataset). 

**SPL Query for flagging High-Risk IPs (with specific time window)** 
Bonus: To evaluate login attempts within a specific time window (rather than across the entire dataset), the query can be modified using bin to group events into fixed intervals. For example, replacing x with a number and m or h with minutes or hours respectively: 

| bin _time span= xm 
| stats count by SourceIP, _time

This enables detection of brute-force attempts within precise time frames, such as every 5 minutes or 1 hour. 



* 3) Export Suspicious IPs to a Lookup Table 

I added this below to the query from right above. 

| where RiskLevel="High"
| outputlookup suspicious_ips.csv 

-> This saves high-risk IPs to a CSV file inside Splunk that can be used in future queries. 

**SPL Query to Export Suspicious IPs to a Lookup Table** 
source="sample_windows_event_log.json" host="Jinnys-MacBook-Pro.local" index="splunk_project_index" sourcetype="_json"
| spath
| search EventID=4625
| rex field=Message "(?s)Account For Which Logon Failed:.*?Account Name:\t(?<AccountName>[^\r\n]+)"
| rex field=Message "Source Network Address:\t(?<SourceIP>\S+)"
| bin _time span=1m
| stats count by SourceIP
| eval RiskLevel=if(count > 20, "High", "Normal")
| sort -count
| where RiskLevel="High"
| outputlookup suspicious_ips.csv  


* 4) Reuse Suspicious IPs in Future Detection 
Later, I can automatically detect repeat offenders with query below: 

**SPL Query to Reuse Suspicious IPs in Future Detection**  
| inputlookup suspicious_ips.csv
| join type=inner SourceIP [
    search index=live_logs EventID=4625 
    | spath
    | rex field=Message "(?s)Account For Which Logon Failed:.*?Account Name:\t(?<AccountName>[^\r\n]+)"
    | rex field=Message "Source Network Address:\t(?<SourceIP>\S+)"
]
  
-> This simulates real-world SOC behavior, tracking known bad actors across new data. 

Detailed explanation: 
| inputlookup suspicious_ips.csv -> Loads the previously saved list of high-risk IP addresses from the lookup table.

| join type=inner SourceIP [...] -> Joins the lookup IPs with the live log data to check if any flagged IPs have reappeared. 

[ search index=live_logs EventID=4625...] ->  the actual detection query that analyzes new logs, so commands like spath, rex, and search are only required inside this subsearch. 


* Important Note: While Splunk alone does not directly control firewalls, it can simulate response actions by tagging malicious IPs for blocking.
In a real-world setup, Splunk can be integrated with SOAR tools like Splunk SOAR (Phantom) to automate responses such as blocking IPs via firewall APIs. 




# Step 8: Future Work - Alerting and Dashboard Creation   
**Objectives** 
Extend the project beyond one-time analysis by:
- Setting up real-time alert
- Designing a reusable dashboard for monitoring
-  Planning for future improvements and integration with automated response systems (e.g., SOAR)


* 1) Setting up real-time alert 
This is a Use Case followed by the defined rule:
“If a single IP address triggers more than 20 failed login attempts in 1 hour, trigger an alert.”

**SPL Query for Alert**
index=splunk_project_index sourcetype="_json"
| spath
| search EventID=4625
| rex field=Message "(?s)Account For Which Logon Failed:.*?Account Name:\t(?<AccountName>[^\r\n]+)"
| rex field=Message "Source Network Address:\t(?<SourceIP>\S+)"
| bin _time span=1h
| stats count by SourceIP, _time
| where count > 20

Here is how to Set the Alert in Splunk- 
1. Go to Search & Reporting
2. Run the query above
3. Click Save As -> Alert
4. Set:
Title: Potential Brute-Force Attack (High Risk)
Description: More than 20 failed login attempts from one Source IP  
Permission: Private
Alert type: Scheduled - Run every hour 
Trigger Condition: if results > 0
Trigger: For each result 
Throttle:  Enabled for SourceIP – Suppress triggering for 60 seconds. 
Actions: Email (yejink0610@gmail.com - my personal email)

5. Save the configuration 

(View image: Personal Project/Brute-force login attempt detection and response project (Splunk)/Windows_Event_Logs/Appendix/Screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-04 at 5.23.24 PM.png)
* Reason for setting Throttle: Used to prevent duplicate notifications if the same IP is detected repeatedly. Useful when there is a lot of data or when an attacker is constantly trying.   


=> I configured a scheduled alert to monitor for IP addresses that trigger more than 20 failed login attempts within a 1-hour window.
This threshold helps detect both aggressive and stealthy brute-force attacks while reducing false positives.
The alert runs hourly and notifies me via email when any matching IP is detected.
To avoid duplicate alerts, I enabled Throttle, which suppresses repeated notifications for 60 seconds. 



* 2) Dashboard Creation 
A security dashboard offers a centralized view of key security metrics to help detect and respond to threats efficiently. It visualizes trends, anomalies, and high-risk activities in real time. This supports rapid incident response and informed decision-making by reducing the need to manually sift through large volumes of raw logs.

Creating my own dashboard was important because it allowed me to define and visualize the exact indicators relevant to brute-force login attempts.  


This is what I did to create my own Dashboard: 
1. I first navigated to Search & Reporting - Dashboards - Create New Dashboard - 
2. Set: 
Dashboard Title - Brute-Force Detection Dashboard 
Description - This dashboard provides visibility into brute-force login attempts by analyzing failed logon events (EventID 4625). It highlights high-risk IPs, attack trends over time, geolocation mapping, and lookup-based threat correlation. 
Permissions - Private 

then clicked on Classic Dashboards 
3. I navigated back to Search & Reporting and ran the queries that I wanted on the dashboard.
After running each query, I clicked "Save As - Existing Dashboard" and selected "Brute-Force Detection Dashboard" - the one that I created in the previous step. Then I named each. 

For example, I named this query as **"Top Brute-Force IPs"**. 
- 
source="sample_windows_event_log.json" index="splunk_project_index" sourcetype="_json"
| spath
| search EventID=4625
| rex field=Message "Source Network Address:\t(?<SourceIP>\S+)"
| stats count by SourceIP
| sort -count

Then I clicked "save to Dashboard" to save the configuration. 

I did rest of the queries in the same way. 


**"Top Brute-Force IPs with Account Context"**
 source="sample_windows_event_log.json" host="Jinnys-MacBook-Pro.local" index="splunk_project_index" sourcetype="_json"
| spath
| search EventID=4625
| rex field=Message "(?s)Account For Which Logon Failed:.*?Account Name:\t(?<AccountName>[^\r\n]+)"
| rex field=Message "Source Network Address:\t(?<SourceIP>\S+)"
| rex field=Message "Logon Type:\t+(?<LogonType>\d+)"
| where LogonType == "3"
| stats count by SourceIP, AccountName
| sort -count

**"Detect Brute-Force attacks with GeoIP enrichment"**
source="sample_windows_event_log.json" host="Jinnys-MacBook-Pro.local" index="splunk_project_index" sourcetype="_json"
| spath
| search EventID=4625
| rex field=Message "(?s)Account For Which Logon Failed:.*?Account Name:\t(?<AccountName>[^\r\n]+)"
| rex field=Message "Source Network Address:\t(?<SourceIP>\S+)"
| rex field=Message "Logon Type:\t+(?<LogonType>\d+)"
| where LogonType == "3"
| iplocation SourceIP
| fillnull value="N/A" City Country Region lat lon
| stats count by SourceIP, AccountName, City, Country, Region, lat, lon
| sort -count 

**"Time-Based Attack Trend"**
source="sample_windows_event_log.json" host="Jinnys-MacBook-Pro.local" index="splunk_project_index" sourcetype="_json"
| spath
| search EventID=4625
| rex field=Message "(?s)Account For Which Logon Failed:.*?Account Name:\t(?<AccountName>[^\r\n]+)"
| rex field=Message "Source Network Address:\t(?<SourceIP>\S+)"
| timechart span=1m count 

=> For this query, viewing a visualized chart is more effective than using the Statistics table. Therefore, I navigated to the Visualization tab and selected Line Chart. When configuring the panel, I set the visualization type to Line Chart accordingly. 

**"Flag High-Risk IPs"**
source="sample_windows_event_log.json" host="Jinnys-MacBook-Pro.local" index="splunk_project_index" sourcetype="_json"
| spath
| search EventID=4625
| rex field=Message "(?s)Account For Which Logon Failed:.*?Account Name:\t(?<AccountName>[^\r\n]+)"
| rex field=Message "Source Network Address:\t(?<SourceIP>\S+)"
| bin _time span=1h 
| stats count by SourceIP, _time
| eval RiskLevel=if(count > 20, "High", "Normal")
| sort -count

 
* Note: 
I excluded Export Suspicious IPs to Lookup Table from Dashboard because the output lookup command is responsible for storing data (record the results as .csv). This is a task that the user will run manually, or automate with a scheduler (for example, alert). The dashboard is a visualization panel, so the file save command doesn't fit.

Similarly, I excluded the lookup-based cross-check mechanism. While it is useful for correlating current activity with known malicious IPs, the lookup returned no matches during the demo period. This panel can be added later when real-time data or a populated lookup table is available. 


3. After adding these panels, I navigated to Search & Reporting - Dashboards tap on the left top. Then I could see this Dashboard below.
(View image: 
Full- Personal Projects/Brute-force login attempt detection and response project (Splunk)/Windows_Event_Logs/Appendix/Screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-04 at 9.54.26 PM.png

* Role of My Brute-Force Detection Dashboard: 
To sum up, the custom Brute-Force Detection Dashboard I built focuses specifically on identifying and analyzing failed login attempts (EventID 4625) to detect brute-force attacks. It highlights top offending IPs, targeted accounts, geolocation of attack sources, and time-based trends. Each panel is tailored to support investigation and risk assessment, helping simulate real-world SOC workflows. Unlike generic dashboards, this one is purpose-built to address a specific attack vector with actionable insights. 



# Step 9: Future Improvements  
To evolve this project beyond a static monitoring solution, I plan to implement the following enhancements:

1. Integration with SOAR (e.g., Splunk Phantom)
Automating threat response actions through a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platform like Splunk Phantom will significantly reduce incident response time and human effort. Possible automated actions include:
- Blocking suspicious IP addresses via firewall APIs
- Creating incident tickets in ticketing systems (e.g., ServiceNow)
- Sending threat intelligence data to external feeds or shared platforms
- Triggering multi-factor authentication (MFA) challenges for targeted accounts
=> This allows a full cycle from detection to response, turning the dashboard into an active defense system.

2. Enhanced Dataset Quality for Realism
Currently, synthetic windows event logs generated by chatGpt-4o provide controlled and predictable behavior. While this is ideal for prototyping and visualization, real-world variability is critical for robust detection. To improve data quality, I can collect logs from honeypots, threat intelligence labs, or abuse feeds (e.g., AbuseIPDB). They should include diverse timestamps, user accounts, geolocations, and behavioral anomalies, while ensuring IP addresses are valid and externally routable to make GeoIP enrichment meaningful. Better quality of sample log data set will better simulate real-world attack scenarios and support more realistic alerting and response logic.

3. MITRE ATT&CK Framework Integration
Mapping observed events to the MITRE ATT&CK framework (https://attack.mitre.org/) helps standardize detection logic and facilitates threat modeling. For example:
3.1 Brute-force login attempts map to T1110 – Brute Force
3.2 Suspicious PowerShell execution (in extended versions) could map to T1059.001 – PowerShell
This integration improves threat visibility and aligns with industry-standard practices for incident response.

* Note: MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a globally recognized framework that outlines how real-world attackers behave.

4. Long-Term Monitoring Enhancements
In future phases, I may also explore:
- Integrating Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) for anomaly detection
- Creating scheduled lookup table updates for continuous threat intelligence matching
- Adding risk scores and correlation searches to prioritize threats 

=> These improvements aim to make the system smarter, more adaptive, and capable of continuous, real-time security monitoring—similar to what real-world SOCs rely on.
