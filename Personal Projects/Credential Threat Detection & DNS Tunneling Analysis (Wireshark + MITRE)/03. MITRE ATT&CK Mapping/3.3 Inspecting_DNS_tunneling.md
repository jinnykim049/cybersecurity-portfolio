**Objective**
Align the observed DNS tunneling behavior with adversary tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. 

# Observed Behavior  
- DNS queries contained long, random-looking but structured subdomains
- Targeted domain .tunnel.onetwog.leb.tech repeatedly used
- Queries sent via UDP port 53
- DNS TXT records used to potentially carry data
- Subdomain patterns suggested encoded payloads 

=> indicate a covert channel for C2 or data exfiltration using DNS tunneling. 

# Mapped MITRE ATT&CK Techniques

**Technique ID: T1071.004**
Technique Name: Application Layer Protocol: DNS 
Explanation- Adversaries can embed data in DNS queries/responses to establish communication channels with C2 servers or exfiltrate sensitive information covertly. The consistent use of long subdomains and TXT records points directly to this technique.   


**Technique ID: T1040**
Technique Name: Network Sniffing
Explanation - Wireshark was used to inspect raw network traffic and detect covert tunneling behavior. This aligns with both defensive detection and adversary usage of network sniffers during reconnaissance or attack execution.
