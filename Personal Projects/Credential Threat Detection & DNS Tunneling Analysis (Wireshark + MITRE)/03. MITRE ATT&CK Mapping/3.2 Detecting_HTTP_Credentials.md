**Objective**
Align the observed behavior (HTTP credentials sent in plaintext) with relevant techniques from the MITRE ATT&CK framework to show how this traffic relates to known adversary behaviors.

# Observed Behavior  
- Captured traffic contains an Authorization: Basic header
- Base64-decoded credentials were: test:fai

=> Transmission occurred via unencrypted HTTP. This behaviour was detected using a simple Wireshark filter (http.authorization) and this indicates a vulnerability to network sniffing and cleartext credential theft


# Mapped MITRE ATT&CK Techniques

**Technique ID: T1040**
Technique Name: Network Sniffing
Explanatioin- Adversaries can capture network traffic to extract credentials, especially when transmitted in cleartext over HTTP.


**Technique ID: T1071.001**
Technique Name: Application Layer Protocol: Web Traffic 
Explanation - Web traffic is used as the communication layer. In this case, adversaries abuse HTTP to transmit credentials.
