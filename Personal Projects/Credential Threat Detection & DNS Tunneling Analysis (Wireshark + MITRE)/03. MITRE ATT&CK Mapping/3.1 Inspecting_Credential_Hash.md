**Objective**
Align the observed behavior (Kerberos pre-authentication traffic exposing encrypted timestamp derived from user credentials) with relevant techniques from the MITRE ATT&CK framework to show how this traffic relates to known adversary behaviors. 

# Observed Behavior  
- Captured traffic contains a PA-DATA: PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP field within the AS-REQ (Authentication Service Request) packet. This field is an encrypted timestamp derived from the user's password
- The blob is deterministic and reproducible, making it vulnerable to offline brute-force cracking.
- The encrypted blob was intercepted using Wireshark with the display filter: kerberos 

=> Although not plain-text, the encrypted timestamp was sent over the network as part of authentication, and represents a point of credential exposure. This behavior indicates risk of offline password cracking and interception-based attacks, especially when usernames are known. 


# Mapped MITRE ATT&CK Techniques

**Technique ID: T1557**
Technique Name: Adversary-in-the-Middle
Explanation: Adversaries can capture authentication traffic, such as Kerberos pre-authentication data, and attempt offline attacks. In this case, capturing the encrypted timestamp (PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP) enables password cracking attempts without further access to the system. 


**Technique ID: T1003.004**
Technique Name: Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory â€“ Kerberos Tickets
Explanation: While this activity did not involve direct memory dumping, the observed behavior aligns with adversary efforts to obtain Kerberos-derived credentials (e.g., TGTs or password-derived keys) which are also common post-exploitation targets via memory dumping or ticket extraction tools.
