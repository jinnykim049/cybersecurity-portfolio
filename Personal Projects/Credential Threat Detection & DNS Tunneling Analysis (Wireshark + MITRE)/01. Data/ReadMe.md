# About 'http-basic-auth.pcap' file 
I downloaded http-basic-auth.pcap file from Github repository by LiamRandall (https://github.com/LiamRandall/BsidesDC-Training/blob/master/http-auth/http-basic-auth.pcap)

With this file, I could work on HTTP Credentials Detection as possible HTTP header includes ID/PW in the form of Authorization. 


# About 'krb-816.cap' file 
I downloaded this file from WireShark Wiki (https://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures) which is the official documentation and knowledge base for the Wireshark network protocol analyzer. It also publicly shares sample packet captures, and that's where I found this file. 

According to its explanation of the website, it is an example of Kerberos traffic when 2 users logon domain from a Windows XP. This file includes Kerberos authentication request, and ticket-granting traffic can be checked with this file 
 
 
# About 'tunnel_example.pcap' file 
I downloaded this file from Github repository by onetwogleb (https://github.com/onetwogleb/dns-tunneling/blob/main/tunnel_example.pcap). 
It includes a compact PCAP with DNS tunneling examples, such as Exfiltration over DNS using tools like DNS2TCP or DNSCat, and that's why I found this pcap file suitable for inspecting DNS tunneling.
