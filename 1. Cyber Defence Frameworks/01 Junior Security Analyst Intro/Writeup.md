## Why understanding SOC Three-Tier Model Matters to Me

As someone preparing for a **SOC Tier 1 internship or junior analyst role**, this model helps me:
- Understand where my responsibilities begin and end
- Know what I need to escalate vs resolve
- Build a roadmap for advancing toward Tier 2/3 roles

My current learning (TryHackMe SOC Level 1, Security+, practical log analysis) aligns well with the Tier 1 requirements. I aim to:
- Master alert triage and basic log interpretation
- Improve my ticketing/report writing skills
- Strengthen my OS/networking fundamentals


## From this chapter (01 Junior Security Analyst Intro), I learned that 
1. Triaging isn't just looking at alerts â€”  it's about understanding why they matter. 

2. Asking the right questions is crucial. I should stay curious about why, how, and when an event occurred.

3. I now have a clearer understanding of what a junior security analyst does. They're not responsible for full remediation but play a key role in identifying and escalating significant events to help protect the organization's assets more effectively.
