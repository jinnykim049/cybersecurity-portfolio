## What is Delivery? 
The Delivery phase is when "Megatron" decides to choose the method for transmitting the payload or the malware. He has plenty of options to choose from: 

1. Phishing email: after conducting the reconnaissance and determining the targets for the attack, the malicious actor would craft a malicious email that would target either a specific person (spearphishing attack) or multiple people in the company. 
- The email would contain a payload or malware.

2. Distributing infected USB drives in public places like coffee shops, parking lots, or on the street": An attacker might decide to conduct a sophisticated USB Drop Attack by printing the company's logo on the USB drives and mailing them to the company while pretending to be a customer sending the USB devices as a gift. 

3. Watering hole attack: It is a targeted attack designed to aim at a specific group of people by compromising the website they are usually visiting and then redirecting them to the malicious website of an attacker's choice.
