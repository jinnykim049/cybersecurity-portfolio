Cyber Kill Chain can be a great tool to improve network defence. 
However, it is NOT perfect and can NOT be the only tool to rely on. 

## About traditional Cyber Kill chain..
The traditional Cyber Kill Chain or Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain was last modified in 2011, which, if you remember, is the date of its establishment. The absence of updates and modifications creates security gaps. 


## So What? - Why it Falls Short
Since the main focus of the framework is on malware delivery and network security, the traditional Cyber Kill Chain will not be able to identify Insider Threats. According to CISA, "The Insider Threat is the potential for an insider to use their authorized access or understanding of an organization to harm that organization." 


# Key recommendation: 
Not only relying on the traditional Cyber Kill Chain model but also referring to MITRE ATT&CK as well as Unified Kill Chain to apply a more comprehensive approach to your defence methodologies.  


## My Final Thoughts on Unit 3
As I was learning about the Cyber Kill Chain, I gained a much clearer understanding of how attackers break into systems and what steps defenders can take to stop them. Breaking down attacks into logical phases made it easier to grasp how cyber incidents unfold.

But I also realized that the traditional model is outdated when it comes to defending against modern threats like fileless malware, lateral movement, or insider attacks. Cybersecurity today demands more adaptive, layered, and behavior-aware models.

This unit taught me not just how to think like an attacker, but also how to critically evaluate security frameworks and know when and how to expand beyond them.
