## What is Exploitation? 
Exploitation is the act of unfairly using someone or something for one's own advantage. 

To gain access to the system, an attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability, and during this phase, "Megatron" got a little bit creative.
For example, he created two phishing emails, one that contains a phishing link to a fake Office 365 login page and another one containing a macro attachment that would execute ransomware when the victim opens it. 

As a result -> 
"Megatron" successfully delivered his exploits and got two victims to click on the malicious link and open the malicious file !

After gaining access to the system, 
the malicious actor could exploit software, system, or server-based vulnerabilities to escalate the privileges or move laterally through the network. 

According to CrowdStrike, lateral movement refers to the techniques that a malicious actor uses after gaining initial access to the victim's machine to move deeper into a network to obtain sensitive data. 

 # Zero-day Exploit  
 * Zero-day:  the name for a cyberattack targeting a software vulnerability that is unknown to the antivirus or software vendors 

The attacker might also apply a "Zero-day Exploit" in this stage. According to FireEye, "the zero-day exploit or a zero-day vulnerability is an unknown exploit in the wild that exposes a vulnerability in software or hardware and can create complicated problems well before anyone realizes something is wrong. A zero-day exploit leaves NO opportunity for detection at the beginning."

These are examples of how an attacker carries out exploitation:
- The victim triggers the exploit by opening the email attachment or clicking on a malicious link.
- Using a zero-day exploit.
- Exploit software, hardware, or even human vulnerabilities. 
An attacker triggers the exploit for server-based vulnerabilities.  




# From unit 3.4, 3.5, I learned ---  
1. Delivery is about how the malware reaches the victim. I had no idea attackers used branded USB drives or mailed fake gifts to companies. That was eye-opening—and a bit scary.

2. Exploitation is where the real attack begins. It’s not just about getting in; it's about taking advantage of what you find. Phishing links and macro attachments are classic methods, but I was surprised by how targeted and layered these attacks can be.

3. I also learned about Zero-day exploits—they're extremely dangerous because no one knows they exist yet. That means even updated antivirus programs won’t catch them. These are often used by highly advanced attackers.

4. The idea of lateral movement helped me understand why initial access is just the beginning. Once inside, attackers try to navigate deeper into the system to find valuable data or infect more machines.
