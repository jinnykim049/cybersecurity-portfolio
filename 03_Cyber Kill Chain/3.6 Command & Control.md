# What is Command & Control? 
After getting persistence and executing the malware on the victim's machine, an attacker opens up the C2 (Command and Control) channel through the malware "to remotely control and manipulate the victim." 

- This term is also known as C&C or C2 Beaconing as a type of malicious communication between a C&C server and malware on the infected host. 
The infected host will consistently communicate with the C2 server. 

- The compromised endpoint would communicate with an external server set up by an attacker to establish a command & control channel. 
After establishing the connection,  the attacker has full control of the victim's machine. Until recently, IRC (Internet Relay Chat) was the traditional C2 channel used by attackers. This is no longer the case, as modern security solutions can easily detect malicious IRC traffic. 


# The most common C2 channels used by adversaries nowadays:
1. The protocols HTTP on port 80 and HTTPS on port 443
: this type of beaconing blends the malicious traffic with the legitimate traffic and can help the attacker evade firewalls.  

2. DNS (Domain Name Server)
: The infected machine makes constant DNS requests to the DNS server that belongs to an attacker, this is also known as DNS Tunneling.


* Important Note: An adversary can be the owner of the C2 infrastructure. 


## From this unit, I learned...
Command and Control (C2) is the phase where the attacker maintains remote access to the infected machine, controlling it through stealthy communication channels like HTTP, HTTPS, or DNS.

I learned about C2 beaconing, which is when the infected host regularly “checks in” with the attacker’s server. This consistent traffic can help analysts detect the presence of malware—if they know what to look for.

The concept of DNS tunneling surprised me—it's clever and scary. Since DNS is such a common protocol, it's easy for attackers to hide malicious traffic inside DNS queries.

It was also interesting to learn how attackers have evolved from using IRC to modern web protocols to stay ahead of detection technologies.
