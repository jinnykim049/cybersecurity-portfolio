## What is Reconnaissance? 
It is discovering and collecting information on the system and the victim. The reconnaissance phase is the planning phase for the adversaries. 

- OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) also falls under reconnaissance. 

# What is OSINT? 
The fist step of an attacker needs to complete to carry out the further phases of an attack. The attacker needs to study the victim by collecting every available piece of information on the company and its employees, such as the company's size, email addresses, phone numbers from publicly available resources to determine the best target for the attack. 


*Email harvesting*
the process of obtaining email addresses from public, paid, or free services, and it is for a phishing attack which is a type of social-engineering attack used to steal sensitive datam, such as login credentials and credit card number.


The attacker will have a big arsenal of tools available for reconnaissance purposes. Here are some of them:

* theHarvester - other than gathering emails, this tool is also capable of gathering names, subdomains, IPs, and URLs using multiple public data sources 
* Hunter.io - this is  an email hunting tool that will let you obtain contact information associated with the domain
* OSINT Framework - OSINT Framework provides the collection of OSINT tools based on various categories
