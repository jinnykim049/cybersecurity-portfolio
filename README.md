# TryHackMe - SOC Level 1 Portfolio

This repository contains my personal write-ups and summaries from completing the **TryHackMe - SOC Level 1 Learning Path**.

The path is designed to simulate real-world SOC (Security Operations Center) analyst responsibilities, including:
- log analysis
- threat detection
- SIEM queries
- attacker behavior investigation

Each directory corresponds to a specific TryHackMe room I completed as part of this path.

## üß† What I learned
- How to analyze Windows Event Logs for suspicious behavior
- How to use Splunk and Kibana for log correlation and threat detection
- Common attacker behaviors (brute-force, privilege escalation, etc.)
- Interpreting Sysmon logs, Event IDs, and network artifacts
