# Level title/ Pain to Attacker 
ðŸŸ  Host & Network Artifacts / High 

## What are Host Artifacts? 
: the traces or observables that attackers leave on the system, for example, registry values, suspicious process execution, attack patterns or IOCs (Indicators of Compromise), files dropped by malicious applications, or anything exclusive to the current threat. 


# Lab 2.4 
From this section, I was able to check suspicious process execution from Word (Microsoft), Suspicious events followed by opening a malicious application, and the files modified/dropped by the malicious actor. 

The report about the malicious sample from a security vendor [PDF_resources/2.4_Lab.pdf], [Screenshots/02/2.4/Screenshot 2025-06-30 at 3.04.55â€¯PM.png] allowed me to identify 

1. the IP address that indicates a process named regidle.exe which makes a POST request to an IP address based in the United States (US) on port 8080, and that is 96.126.101.6.
*Check [Screenshots/02/2.4/Screenshot 2025-06-30 at 2.53.27â€¯PM.png] to see where I found it. 

2. the name of the malicious executable that the actop drops, which is G_jugk.exe. 
*Check [Screenshots/02/2.4/creenshot 2025-06-30 at 3.02.58â€¯PM.png] to see where I found it. 

3. Number of vendors that determine this host (1,2) to be malicious via Virustotal. There are 9 vendors that determine it to be malicious. 
*Check [Screenshots/02/2.4/Screenshot 2025-06-30 at 3.07.21â€¯PM.png] to see where I found it.  



## From this section, I learned.. 
1. How to trace suspicious behavior from Microsoft Office applications (e.g., Word)

2. How attackers drop and execute malicious payloads through seemingly harmless processes

3. How to correlate multiple host artifacts (processes, files, IP connections) to identify Indicators of Compromise

4. The value of cross-verifying threat data through multiple vendor reports
