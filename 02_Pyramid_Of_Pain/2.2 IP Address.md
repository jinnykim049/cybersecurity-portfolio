# Level title/ Pain to Attacker 
ðŸŸ¢ IP Addresses / Low 

## What is IP Address? 
: It is used to identify and device connected to a network.  We rely on IP addresses to send and receive the information over the network.  

In the Pyramid of Pain, IP addresses are indicated with the color green.

A common defense tactic is..:
To block, drop, or deny inbound requests from IP addresses on your parameter or external firewall. This tactic is often not bulletproof as itâ€™s trivial for an experienced adversary to recover simply by using a new public IP address. 

## Fast Flux 
Fast Flux is a DNS technique used by botnets to hide phishing, web proxying, malware delivery, and malware communication activities behind compromised hosts acting as proxies. The purpose of using the Fast Flux network is to make the communication between malware and its command and control server (C&C) challenging to be discovered by security professionals. 

So, the primary concept of a Fast Flux network is having multiple IP addresses associated with a domain name, which is constantly changing. 


# Mini Lab 2.2 
I was able to read the report generated from 'any.run' and figure out the first IP address/ domain the malicious process (PID 1632) attempts to communicate with, which are 50.87.136.52 and craftingalegacy.com

Check [Screenshots/02/2.2/Screenshot 2025-06-30 at 1.28.45â€¯PM.png] to see where I found them in the any.run report.  


# From Section 2.1-2.2, I learned... 
1. Hash values help uniquely identify files and are crucial for malware tracking and detection. But relying solely on hash values is weak because attackers can easily alter them.

2. IP addresses can reveal attacker infrastructure, but they are unstable indicators since they are easily changed.

3. Fast Flux is a sophisticated evasion technique where malware communicates through constantly rotating IP addresses, making detection much harder.

4. Using platforms like Any.run and VirusTotal enhances the ability to detect and understand malware behavior in a real-world context.
