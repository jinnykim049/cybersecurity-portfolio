# Level title/ Pain to Attacker 
ðŸŸ£ Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) / Extremely High 

## What are TTPs? 
TTPs stands for Tactics, Techniques & Procedures. 
This includes the whole MITRE ATT&CK Matrix, which means all the steps taken by an adversary to achieve his goal, starting from phishing attempts to persistence and data exfiltration. 

If you can detect and respond to the TTPs quickly, you leave the adversaries almost no chance to fight back. 

Here is an example -> if you (security analyst) could detect a Pass-the-Hash attack using Windows Event Log Monitoring and remediate it, you would be able to find the compromised host very quickly and stop the lateral movement inside your network. 

This give only two options to the attackers:
1. Go back, do more research and training, reconfigure their custom tools.
2. Give up and find another target. 

# Extra: 
This is ATT&CK Matrix for Enterprise:
- Reconnaissance (10 techniques)
- Resource Development (8 techniques)
- Initial Access (11 techniques)
- Execution (16 techniques)
- Persistence (23 techniques)
- Privilege Escalation (14 techniques)
- Defense Evasion (45 techniques)
- Credential Access (17 techniques)
- Discovery (33 techniques) 
- Lateral Movement (9 techniques) 
- Collection (17 techniques) 
- Command Control (18 techniques)
- Exfiltration (9 techniques)
- Impact (15 techniques) 


# Analyst Insight
From MITRE ATT&CK Matrix, I was able to tell that Cobalt Strike is a commercial, remote access tool that Chimera (a China-based hacking group that has been active since 2018) use for C2 beacons and data exfiltration  



 ## From Section 2.6 - 2.7, I learned that..
1. Detecting or neutralizing the attackerâ€™s tools (such as custom malware, EXEs, and backdoors) forces them to either rebuild or abandon the attack.

2. Fuzzy hashing (e.g., using ssdeep) is useful for detecting variants of known malware with only small differences.

3. Platforms like SOC Prime and MalwareBazaar help security analysts hunt and respond more effectively by sharing detection rules and malware samples.

4. TTP-level detection is the most effective strategy, as it targets how attackers operate, not just what tools or signatures they use.

5. Understanding frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK empowers defenders to map attacker behavior and break the kill chain early in the process.
