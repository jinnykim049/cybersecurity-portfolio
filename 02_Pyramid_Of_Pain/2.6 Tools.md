# Level title/ Pain to Attacker  
ðŸ”´ Tools / Very High 

## In Tools stage, 
Since it got harder to attack, the attacker would most likely give up trying to break into your network or go back and try to create a new tool that serves the same purpose.  

Attackers would use the utilities to create 
- malicious **macro documents (maldocs)** for spearphishing attempts
- a **backdoor** that can be used to establish C2 (Command and Control Infrastructure), any custom .EXE, and .DLL files, payloads, or password crackers. 


## How to against these attackers? 
1. Antivirus signatures, detection rules, and YARA rules: 
Great weapons for security analysts to use against attackers at this stage.

2. MalwareBazaar and Malshare:
Good resources to provide security analysts with access to the samples, malicious feeds, and YARA results - these all can be very helpful when it comes to threat hunting and incident response. 

3. Fuzzy hashing:
A strong weapon against the attacker's tools to perform similarity analysis - match two files with minor differences based on the fuzzy hash values. 
One of the examples of fuzzy hashing is the usage of SSDeep, CTPH (Context Triggered Piecewise Hashing)


**SOC Prime Threat Detection Marketplace**
For detection rules, SOC Prime Threat Detection Marketplace is a great platform, where security professionals share their detection rules for different kinds of threats including the latest CVE's that are being exploited in the wild by adversaries.
