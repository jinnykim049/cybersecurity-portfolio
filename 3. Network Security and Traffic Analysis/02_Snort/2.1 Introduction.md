# What is SNORT? 
SNORT is an open-source, rule-based Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (NIDS/NIPS). 
It was developed and still maintained by Martin Roesch, open-source contributors, and the Cisco Talos team. Snort IPS uses a series of rules that help define malicious network activity and uses those rules to find packets that match against them and generate alerts for users."
