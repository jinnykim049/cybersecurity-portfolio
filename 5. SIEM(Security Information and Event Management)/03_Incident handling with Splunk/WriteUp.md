**Final Reflection for Unit 3: Incident handling with Splunk** 
Throughout Unit 3, I learned how to investigate different stages of a cyberattack using Splunk and OSINT tools. I gained hands-on experience detecting reconnaissance activities, brute-force attacks, malware installation, and command-and-control communications by analyzing both network and host logs. Mapping attacker behavior to the Cyber Kill Chain helped me understand the full scope of an incident, while tools like VirusTotal and Robtex showed me how to expand investigations using threat intelligence. Although some tasks were challenging at first, especially locating the right data fields, I gradually built confidence in navigating Splunk, writing efficient queries, and piecing together attacker activities. With more practice, I believe I can handle incident investigations more quickly and effectively.
