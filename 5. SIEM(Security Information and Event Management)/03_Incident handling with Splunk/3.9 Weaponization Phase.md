# Weaponization   
In the weaponization phase, the adversaries would:
- Create Malware / Malicious document to gain initial access / evade detection etc.
- Establish domains similar to the target domain to trick users.
- Create a Command and Control Server for the post-exploitation communication/activity etc.

**here is what I'm going to learn in this page.** 
I have found some domains / IP addresses associated with the attacker during the investigations. This task will mainly look into OSINT sites to see what more information we can get about the adversary.

*OSINT: Open source intelligence (OSINT) is the act of gathering and analyzing publicly available data for intelligence purposes. 


So far, I have found a domain 'prankglassinebracket.jumpingcrab.com ' associated with this attack. 
The first task would be to find the IP address tied to the domains that may potentially be pre-staged to attack Wayne Enterprise.

In the following exercise, I will be searching the online Threat Intel sites for any information like IP addresses/domains / Email addresses associated with this domain which could help me know more about this adversary.

# Robtex:
Robtex is a Threat Intel site that provides information about IP addresses, domain names, etc.

I can search for the domain (prankglassinebracket.jumpingcrab.com ) on the robtex site. Then I will get IP addresses, some domains/subdomains, and more associated with this domain. 
Reference: https://www.robtex.com/dns-lookup/prankglassinebracket.jumpingcrab.com

Next, I can search for the IP address 23.22.63.114 on this Threat Intel site. Then I found that his IP is associated with some domains that look pretty similar to the WAYNE Enterprise site. (e.g, wanecorpinc.com, wayncorpinc.com, waynecorinc.com.. )


# Virustotal
Virustotal is an OSINT site used to analyze suspicious files, domains, IP, etc. When I search for the IP address on the virustotal site and go to the RELATIONS tab, I can see all the domains associated with this IP which look similar to the Wayn Enterprise company. 
In the domain list, I saw the domain that is associated with the attacker www.po1s0n1vy.com, then I can search for this domain again on the virustotal. (I can also look for the whois information on whois.domaintools.com) 


# Answer the questions below
Q1. What IP address has P01s0n1vy tied to domains that are pre-staged to attack Wayne Enterprises? 
A1. 23.22.63.114 

This IP address appeared multiple times throughout Unit 3 as the destination of outbound traffic from the compromised web server. It was tied to the suspicious domain 'prankglassinebracket.jumpingcrab.com', which hosted the malicious payload (poisonivy-is-coming-for-you-batman.jpeg).. 

Q2. Based on the data gathered from this attack and common open-source intelligence sources for domain names, what is the email address that is most likely associated with the P01s0n1vy APT group? 
A2. lillian.rose@po1s0n1vy.com

I searched for the suspicious domains at https://otx.alienvault.com

# From this chapter, I learned... 
1. how to use OSINT tools like Robtex, VirusTotal, and AlienVault to gather more context on domains and IPs involved in an attack.
2. that attackers often register domains that look very similar to legitimate company names to trick users — these are called typosquatting domains.
3. I also learned that by pivoting on IPs and domains, I can discover related infrastructure, like emails and subdomains, giving a bigger picture of the attacker’s operation. 

**Reflection**
Using public tools to trace attacker infrastructure made me realize how much threat intel is available online. It was interesting to see how domains, IPs, and emails all tie together and how OSINT can uncover the attacker’s broader plan.
