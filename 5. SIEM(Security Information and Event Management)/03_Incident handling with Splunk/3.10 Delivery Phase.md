# Delivery 
Attackers create malware and infect devices to gain initial access or evade defenses and find ways to deliver it through different means. 


**here is what I'm going to learn in this page.** 
We have identified various IP addresses, domains and Email addresses associated with the adversary. Our task for this lesson would be to 

1. use the information we have about the adversary and use various Threat Hunting platforms and OSINT sites to find any malware linked with the adversary.

Threat Intel report suggested that this adversary group Poison lvy appears to have a secondary attack vector in case the initial compromise fails. Our objective would be to 

2. understand more about the attacker and their methodology and correlate the information found in the logs with various threat Intel sources.

Below are OSINT sites
-Virustotal
-ThreatMiner
-Hybrid-Analysis
-ThreatMiner


# ThreatMiner 
I can start investigation by looking for the IP 23.22.63.114 on the Threat Intel site ThreatMiner(https://www.threatminer.org/host.php?q=23.22.63.114#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=23.22.63.114&gsc.page=1). 
I could find three files associated with this IP, from which one file with the hash value  c99131e0169171935c5ac32615ed6261 seemed to be malicious with many words like Trojan, Backdoor, Malware,.. (View image: 5. SIEM(Security Information and Event Management)/Screenshots/03/3.9/Screenshot 2025-07-25 at 10.12.45 PM.png)

Then I can click on this MD5 hash value to see the metadata and other important information about this particular file.

# Virus Total 
From searching for the hash on this website, https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload, I can get information about the metadata about this Malware in the Details tab. 

Reference: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/9709473ab351387aab9e816eff3910b9f28a7a70202e250ed46dba8f820f34a8/community

# Hybrid-Analysis 
Hybrid Analysis is a beneficial site that shows the behavior Analysis of any malware. I can look at all the activities performed by this Malware after being executed. Some of the information that Hybrid-Analysis provides are:

-Network Communication.
-DNS Requests
-Contacted Hosts with Country Mapping
-Strings
-MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
-Malicious Indicators.
-DLLs Imports / Exports
-Mutex Information if created
-File Metadata
-Screenshots

# Answer the questions below
Q1. What is the HASH of the Malware associated with the APT group?
A1. c99131e0169171935c5ac32615ed6261

Read threatminer section from the above.

Q2. What is the name of the Malware associated with the Poison Ivy Infrastructure?
A2. MirandaTateScreensaver.scr.exe

I could find the answer from Hybrid-Analysis. 


# From this chapter, I learned that.. 
1. Threat hunting doesn’t stop at just identifying IPs or domains. I can also trace actual malware linked to those indicators.
2. OSINT tools like ThreatMiner, VirusTotal, and Hybrid-Analysis help uncover details like file hashes, behavior analysis, and associated infrastructure.
3. Even if the first attack vector fails, attackers often have backup plans. 

**Reflection**
This chapter showed how public intel tools can reveal a lot about a threat actor’s malware from metadata to behavior to even how it's disguised. Exploring public intel tools and seeing what information each one reveals was an interesting activity for me.
