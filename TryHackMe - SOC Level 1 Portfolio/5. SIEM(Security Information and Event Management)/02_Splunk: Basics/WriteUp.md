# From this chapter (Splunk: Basics), I learned.. 
- Splunk is a SIEM solution that provides the ability to collect, analyze and correlate the network and machine logs in real-time. 
- Splunk has three main components: Indexer, Search Head, Forwarder. 
"Indexer" is to process the data it receives from forwarders
"Seach Head" is to search the indexed logs and get the result in a form of field-value pairs or presentable figures. 
"Forwarder" is to collect the data and send it to the Splunk instance.

**Final Reflection**
I found this chapter and the lab exercise really helpful in understanding how Splunk works and how it's used in real-world environments in a basic level. The biggest takeaway was learning how to extract meaningful insights from logs by applying filters and field-based searches. This skill feels essential for any future role in security analysis or threat detection.
Overall, this chapter gave me confidence in navigating Splunk and made me realize how powerful it can be when investigating incidents or monitoring systems in real time.
