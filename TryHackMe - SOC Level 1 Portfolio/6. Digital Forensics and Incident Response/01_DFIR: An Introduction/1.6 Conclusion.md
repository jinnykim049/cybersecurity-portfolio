# From this chapter, I learned... 
- what DFIR is and where it is used.
- why we need to perform DFIR.
- the basic concepts like the chain of custody, evidence preservation, and order of volatility.
- about some of the tools used in the industry like EZ tools, KAPE, Autopsy, etc.
- The PICERL process for incident response, which is Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned

It was interesting because it gave me a clearer picture of how DFIR is not just about reacting to cyber incidents, but also about strategic preparation and smart investigation.
Through this chapter, I now clearly understand how essential it is the entire security lifecycle â€” from identifying false positives to actually preventing re-infection by understanding attacker behavior.

I especially found the concepts of artifact collection and timeline creation helpful, since they made me realize how technical data needs to be organized to tell a clear, chronological story so that they can be handled properly by the professionals. 

Tools like KAPE and Volatility also stood out to me. I want to explore them more hands-on in future labs.

Overall, this chapter helped me know the order and the correlation between digital evidence, analysis, and real-world response efforts. It also reminded me that just having tools isn't enough, knowing when and how to use them is significantly important.
