# These are what I learned from this Chapter 01
- Endpoint Security Fundamentals tackled Core Windows Processes and Sysinternals.
- Endpoint Logging and Monitoring introduced logging functionalities such as Windows Event Logging and Sysmon and monitoring/investigation tools such as OSQuery and Wazuh.
- Endpoint Log Analysis highlighted the importance of having a methodology such as baselining and event correlation.
- Having a baseline document aids me in differentiating malicious events from benign ones.
- Event correlation provides a deeper understanding of the concurrent events triggered by the malicious activity.
- Taking note of each significant artefact is crucial in the investigation.
- Other potentially affected assets should be inspected and remediated using the collected malicious artefacts.
