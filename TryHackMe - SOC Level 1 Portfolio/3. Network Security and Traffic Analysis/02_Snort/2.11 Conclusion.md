# From this Chapter, I learned.. 
what Snort is, how it operates, and how to create and use the rules to investigate threats.

Understanding and practising the fundamentals is crucial before creating advanced rules and using additional options.

Here are some tips: 
1. Do not create complex rules at once, try to add options step by step to notice possible syntax errors or any other problem easily.
2. Do not reinvent the wheel; use it or modify/enhance it if there is a smooth rule.
3. Take a backup of the configuration files before making any change.
4. Never delete a rule that works properly. Comment it if you don't need it.
5. Test newly created rules before migrating them to production.

A great way to quickly recall snort rules and commands is to download and refer to the TryHackMe snort cheatsheet. (Screenshots/Network Security and Traffic Analysis/02/2.11/SnortCheatsheet-TryHackMe-1647343678716.pdf)
