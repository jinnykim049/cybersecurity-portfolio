## What is Pyramid of Pain? 
Pyramid of Pain is a concept that is being applied to cybersecurity solutions like Cisco Security, SentinelOne, and SOCRadar to improve the effectiveness of CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence), threat hunting, and incident response exercises.

 
It is a visual model that ranks IOCs based on how much they "hurt" or inconvenience the attacker when you detect or block them.

From bottom (easy to change) to top (hard to change)(Pyramid Shape) 
Therefore, the higher up the pyramid, the harder it is for attackers to adapt if you detect/block that indicator.
