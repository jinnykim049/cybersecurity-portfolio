# Key insights 
- The UKC is a modern extension of other frameworks, such as Lockheed Martin's "Cyber Kill Chain" framework. 


# From this unit, I learned..
At first, the concept of the Kill Chain felt a bit difficult to understand, but the more I learned about it, the more interesting it became. It felt like I was following an attacker’s steps one by one, and that really helped me picture how attacks actually happen.

I found the Unified Kill Chain (UKC) especially useful because it’s much more detailed and realistic compared to older models. Instead of just saying “an attack happened,” it shows exactly how, why, and where the attacker moves. It kind of felt like watching a movie, where you follow the story of an attack unfolding.

What stood out to me the most were the Reconnaissance and Persistence phases. It was honestly a bit scary to realize that attackers can secretly observe and gather information about a system before they even launch their attack. And the fact that they can leave behind backdoors or malicious services to regain access later—that was eye-opening. It made me realize that stopping the first attack isn’t enough. We need continuous monitoring and defense.

I also learned about Threat Modeling for the first time, and I really liked how it breaks down the process of improving security. It’s not just about fixing things randomly—it’s about understanding what’s important, where the weaknesses are, and how to respond properly. I think this approach will be very helpful if I ever build an app or system in the future.

Toward the end of the unit, I learned about Collection, Exfiltration, and Impact phases. These made me realize that the goal isn’t always just to get in and steal data—sometimes attackers use that data to cause serious damage, like leaking private information or deploying ransomware to demand money. It made the whole concept of cybersecurity feel more real and urgent to me.

Overall, this unit helped me understand that attacks aren’t just random event but they’re often well-planned strategies. I’ve also started thinking more from the attacker’s point of view, which I think is important for becoming a better defender. 
Going forward, I want to explore other frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK and learn how to apply these ideas in real-world situations.
