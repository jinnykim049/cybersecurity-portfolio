## In this Unit, 
I got to learn the Phishhtool using virtual machine, that I would add my toolkit of email analysis tool. 

# About Email Phishing
When unsuspecting users are opening and accessing malicious files and links sent to them by email as they appear to be legitimate. 

From this acion, adversaries infect their victims' systems with malware and harvest their credentials and personal data, and with these, they perform other actions such as financial fraud or ransomware attacks. 


## What is Phishtool? 
A tool that seeks to elevate the perception of phishing as a severe form of attack and provide a responsive means of email security. 

Through email analysis, security analysts can uncover email IOCs, prevent breaches and provide forensic reports that could be used in phishing containment and training engagements.

PhishTool has two accessible versions: Community and Enterprise. * This unit mainly focus on the Community version and its core features. 


# How to use Phishtool? 
First sign up for an account in https://app.phishtool.com/sign-up/community to use the tool. 
After the sign up, I got to see this page.

The core features include:
- Perform email analysis: retrieves metadata from phishing emails and provides analysts with the relevant explanations and capabilities.

- Heuristic intelligence: OSINT is baked into the tool to provide analysts with the intelligence needed to stay ahead of persistent attacks and understand what TTPs were used to evade security controls and allow the adversary to social engineer a target.

- Classification and reporting: Phishing email classifications are conducted to allow analysts to take action quickly. Additionally, reports can be generated to provide a forensic record that can be shared.

* Note: Additional features such as 1. Managing user-reported phishing events, 2. Reporting phishing email findings back to users and keep them engaged in the process, and 3. Email stack integration with Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace are available on the Enterprise version:


*This below is explanation about the "Analysis" tab:*
In the Analysis tab, users submit email for analysis in the stated file formats. 

Once uploaded, users can see the details of the email for a more in-depth look. These are the following tabs with this action. 

- Headers: Provides the routing information of the email, such as source and destination email addresses, Originating IP and DNS addresses and Timestamp.
- X-headers: These are extension headers added by the recipient mailbox to provide additional information about the email.
- Received Lines: Details on the email traversal process across various SMTP servers for tracing purposes.
- Security: Details on email security frameworks and policies such as Sender Policy Framework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC).
- Attachments: Lists any file attachments found in the email.
- Message URLs: Associated external URLs found in the email will be found here.

On the right-hand side of the screen, the users can see the Plaintext and Source details of the email.

Above the Plaintext section, there is a Resolve checkmark. Here, the user get to perform the resolution of the analysis by classifying the email, setting up flagged artefacts and setting the classification codes. 
Once the email has been classified, the details will appear on the Resolution tab on the analysis of the email.

Then, the user add PhishTool to list of email analysis tools.


# Lab 
You are a SOC Analyst and have been tasked to analyse a suspicious email, Email1.eml. To solve the task, open the email using Thunderbird on the VM, analyse it. 

Q. What social media platform is the attacker trying to pose as in the email?
A. Linkedin 
(See where I found the answer: 
Click "Email1.eml" file from emails folder-> Screenshots/Cyber Threat Intelligence/02/2.4/Screenshot 2025-07-13 at 9.03.08 PM.png)

Q. What is the senders email address?
A. darkabutla@sc500.whpservers.com 
(See where I found the answer: Screenshots/Cyber Threat Intelligence/02/2.4/Screenshot 2025-07-13 at 9.05.48 PM.png)

Q. What is the recipient's email address?
A. cabbagecare@hotsmail.com

Q. What is the Originating IP address? Defang the IP address? 
A. 204[.]93[.]183[.]11

Click more and View Source from "Email1.eml" file -> Screenshots/Cyber Threat Intelligence/02/2.4/Screenshot 2025-07-13 at 9.20.39 PM.png 

and find the originating IP address, and that is 204.93.183.11 -> Screenshots/Cyber Threat Intelligence/02/2.4/Screenshot 2025-07-13 at 9.21.09 PM.png

I need to defang this IP address (204.93.183.11) so make it to 204[.]93[.]183[.]11. This is an answewr. 

* defang means to make it non-clickable or non-executable in order to prevent accidental access or execution. 


Q. How many hops did the email go through to get to the recipient? 

A. 4

This question mean How many mail servers did the email pass through before it reached the recipient’s inbox. 

* Hop: one step in the journey of an email. That means, one mail server the email touches as it moves from sender to receiver.  
I could find the number of hops by looking at the email headers, specifically the “Received” fields. 

and there are four "Recevied" in the source file.

# From this Unit, I learned... 
how to use PhishTool to analyze suspicious emails and identify phishing indicators like sender address, originating IP, and malicious links. I practiced investigating a phishing email posing as LinkedIn, extracted key information from the headers, and learned how to defang IP addresses. This hands-on lab improved my skills in email forensics and added PhishTool to my cybersecurity toolkit
