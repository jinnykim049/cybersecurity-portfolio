## What is Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)? 
It is an evidence-based knowledge about adversaries, including their indicators, tactics, motivations, and actionable advice against them. These can be utilised to protect critical assets and inform cyber security teams and management business decisions.

It would be typical to use the terms “data”, “information”, and “intelligence” interchangeably. 

*Data*: Discrete indicators associated with an adversary, such as IP addresses, URLs or hashes.

*Information*: A combination of multiple data points that answer questions such as “How many times have employees accessed tryhackme.com within the month?”

*Intelligence*: The correlation of data and information to extract patterns of actions based on contextual analysis.

# The primary goal of CTI
to understand the relationship between your operational environment and your adversary and how to defend your environment against any attacks. 

You would seek this goal by developing your cyber threat context by trying to answer the following questions:
- Who’s attacking you?
- What are their motivations?
- What are their capabilities?
- What artefacts and indicators of compromise (IOCs) should you look out for?

With these questions, threat intelligence would be gathered from different sources under the following categories:

- Internal:
Corporate security events such as vulnerability assessments and incident response reports.
Cyber awareness training reports.
System logs and events.

- Community:
Open web forums.
Dark web communities for cybercriminals.

- External:
Threat intel feeds (Commercial & Open-source)
Online marketplaces.
Public sources include government data, publications, social media, financial and industrial assessments.


# Threat Intelligence Classifications
Threat Intel is geared towards understanding the relationship between your operational environment and your adversary. With this in mind, we can break down threat intel into the following classifications: 

*Strategic Intel*: High-level intel that looks into the organisation’s threat landscape and maps out the risk areas based on trends, patterns and emerging threats that may impact business decisions.

*Technical Intel*: Looks into evidence and artefacts of attack used by an adversary. Incident Response teams can use this intel to create a baseline attack surface to analyse and develop defence mechanisms.
- IP addresses, Hashes and other threat artefacts would be found under this classification. 

*Tactical Intel*: Assesses adversaries’ tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This intel can strengthen security controls and address vulnerabilities through real-time investigations.

*Operational Intel*: Looks into an adversary’s specific motives and intent to perform an attack. Security teams may use this intel to understand the critical assets available in the organisation (people, processes and technologies) that may be targeted.




 ## From this Unit, I learned.. 
1. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is more than just collecting data, it’s about analyzing threats in context to defend systems more effectively.

2. I learned the difference between data, information, and intelligence, which made things much clearer. I also found the breakdown of strategic, tactical, technical, and operational intel really helpful — it showed me how different types of intel support different parts of security operations and decision-making.

3. One key takeaway was that CTI helps answer important questions like: Who is attacking us? Why? How? That makes threat detection feel more proactive and less reactive.
