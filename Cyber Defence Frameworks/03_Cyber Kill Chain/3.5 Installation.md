# Backdoor
The backdoor lets an attacker bypass security measures and hide the access. A backdoor is also known as an "access point". 

* Once the attacker gets access to the system...:
The attacker would want to reaccess the system 1. if he loses the connection to it 2. or if he got detected and got the initial access removed, 3. or if the system is later patched. 

When the attacker needs to install a persistent backdoor, he will no longer have access to it. 

# - Persistent backdoor
: Let the attacker access the system he compromised in the past. 

The persistence can be achieved through:

- 1. Installing a web shell on the webserver. 
* web shell: a malicious script written in web development programming languages such as ASP, PHP, or JSP used by an attacker to maintain access to the compromised system. Because of the web shell simplicity and file formatting (.php, .asp, .aspx, .jsp, etc.) can be difficult to detect and might be classified as benign.  

- 2. Installing a backdoor on the victim's machine. 
Example: the attacker can use Meterpreter to install a backdoor on the victim's machine. Meterpreter is a Metasploit Framework payload that gives an interactive shell from which an attacker can interact with the victim's machine remotely and execute the malicious code.


- 3. Creating or modifying Windows services. 
This technique is known as T1543.003 on MITRE ATT&CK - a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world scenarios. 
3.1: An attacker can create or modify the Windows services to execute the malicious scripts or payloads regularly as a part of the persistence. 
Tools like sc.exe (sc.exe lets you Create, Start, Stop, Query, or Delete any Windows Service) and Reg to modify service configurations are used by attackers. 
3.2: The attacker can also masquerade the malicious payload by using a service name that is known to be related to the Operating System or legitimate software. 


- 4. Adding the entry to the "run keys" for the malicious payload in the Registry or the Startup Folder. 
By this, the payload will execute each time the user logs in on the computer. 
According to MITRE ATT&CK,...: there is a startup folder location for individual user accounts and a system-wide startup folder that will be checked no matter what user account logs in.
 


# Timestomping 
The Timestomping technique lets an attacker modify the file's timestamps, including the modify, access, create and change times.

- Attacker can use it 1. to avoid detection by the forensic investigator and also 2. to make the malware appear as a part of a legitimate program. 



## From this unit, I learned...
1. A web shell is a malicious script uploaded to a web server that allows remote access. It’s often hard to detect due to its file format and simplicity.

2. Persistence is key for attackers to maintain long-term access. They can achieve it through backdoors installed using Meterpreter, editing Windows services, or modifying Registry keys and Startup folders.

3. The MITRE ATT&CK framework helps classify real-world tactics like T1543.003 for modifying services.

4. Timestomping was new to me—it’s a stealthy technique where attackers alter file timestamps to blend malware in with system files and confuse investigators.
