## -- Research & Detection Strategy of one of the APT Group --
* APT Group: Advanced Persistent Threat Groups. They are threat actors operated by nation states or state-sponsored groups. 

**< APT-C-36 (Blind Eagle)>**
The threat actor group APT-C-36, commonly referred to as Blind Eagle, is based in South America and has mostly targeted private and public institutions in Colombia. They have a reputation for using compromised infrastructure and malicious domains for Command and Control (C2), as well as spearphishing campaigns.

According to the Rapid7 Threat Command Threat Library, this detection finds a DNS resolution request to a malicious domain linked to APT-C-36 that has been publicly reported. These domains are frequently hosted on recently registered domains or compromised infrastructure.  

There are three detection rules tied to APT-C-36 activity, sourced from the Rapid7 Threat Command Threat Library. 
I will explain them below. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
1. Suspicious NDNS Request â€“ APT-C-36 Related Domain Observed 
: It detects DNS resolution of a domain associated with APT-C-36. These domains may be used in phishing or C2 activities via compromised or attacker-controlled infrastructure. 

MITRE ATT&CK Techniques 
T1583 â€“ Acquire Infrastructure
T1583.001 â€“ Domains
T1584 â€“ Compromise Infrastructure
T1584.001 â€“ Domains

Pyramid of Pain Level: ðŸŸ¡ Domain Name â€“ Medium pain
Attackers can register or compromise new domains relatively easily, but detection still slows them down and helps map infrastructure reuse.


[ âœ… Recommendation ]  
- Investigate whether the domain access was user-initiated or malware-driven.
- If malicious, rebuild the host and reset user credentials.
- Add the domain to threat feeds and monitor for similar patterns. 

----------  
2. Suspicious Process â€“ APT-C-36 Related Binary Executed
: It detects execution of a binary file whose hash matches a known APT-C-36 malware sample. Attackers may use system tools or custom EXEs/DLLs.

MITRE ATT&CK Techniques
T1059 â€“ Command and Scripting Interpreter
T1105 â€“ Ingress Tool Transfer

Pyramid of Pain Level: ðŸ”µ Hash Values â€“ Very low pain
Easiest for attackers to evade â€” modifying one byte produces a new hash. Still useful for identifying known malware in early stages.

[ âœ… Recommendation ]
- Validate execution path and source.
- Consider the use of fuzzy hashing (e.g., ssdeep) to catch file variants.
- If malicious, reimage the machine and rotate credentials.

----------   
3. Suspicious Web Request â€“ APT-C-36 Related Domain Observed
: It detects outbound HTTP/HTTPS requests to a known APT-C-36 domain â€” potentially part of C2 traffic or malware delivery.

MITRE ATT&CK Techniques

T1583 â€“ Acquire Infrastructure
T1583.001 â€“ Domains
T1583.003 â€“ Virtual Private Server
T1583.004 â€“ Server
T1584 â€“ Compromise Infrastructure
T1584.001 â€“ Domains
T1584.003 â€“ Virtual Private Server
T1584.004 â€“ Server

Pyramid of Pain Level: ðŸŸ  Network Artifacts â€“ High pain
HTTP request patterns, URIs, or headers (like User-Agent) are harder to change consistently and can yield strong behavioral detection.

[ âœ… Recommendation ]
- Review proxy or firewall logs for full request context.
- Set up alerting for repeat requests or known C2 patterns.
- Use TLS inspection where allowed to enrich telemetry. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------  
**Final Reflection**
By examining these three detection rules, I learned how APT-C-36 infrastructure (domains, VPS, servers) can be monitored through DNS and HTTP activity.
I recognized that hash-based detections are weak if used alone, but valuable when combined with fuzzy matching or threat intelligence.
I understood how network-level detection (URIs, beacons) offers high-value insights that significantly disrupt adversaries.
This exercise helped me see how multiple MITRE ATT&CK techniques map to one actor â€” helping defenders build layered detection strategies across the Pyramid of Pain.
