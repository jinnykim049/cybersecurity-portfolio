As part of the dissemination phase of the lifecycle, CTI is also distributed to organisations using published threat reports. These reports come from technology and security companies that research emerging and actively used threat vectors. They are valuable for consolidating information presented to all suitable stakeholders. 
Some notable threat reports come from Mandiant, Recorded Future and Palo Alto Unit42.
